# Nodejs-Auth

## Node.js Authentication App
 I worked previously with Node.js as Icreated a project that has basic RESTful API using node and express,
but I havenâ€™t gotten into authentication and containerization an app.

I used JWT for token authentication and docker for containerization

That gave me a boost of understanding various authentication methods and containerization and in the future, I may extend it to use something like passport.js to create sessions and to  support other authentaication methods like  OpenID and OAuth
